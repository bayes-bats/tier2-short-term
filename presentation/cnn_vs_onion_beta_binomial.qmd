## Outline

-   Introduce the course context
-   Introduce the activity
-   Construct the prior
-   Take the quiz!

## Course Context

-   **Target Course:** Intro to Probability and Statistics or Bayesian Statistics Course

-   **Student Background:**

-   Basic probability concepts (e.g., probability of success/failure)

-   What a probability distribution represents

-   Familiarity with the concept of conditional probability

-   Some prior experience with R programming

## Activity Overview

-   **Goal:** Show how priors, data, and posteriors interact with a real example

![Frontpage of the Onion.

The Onion, on the other hand, is (according to Wikipedia) â€œan American news satire organization.

How well do people distinguish real news stories published on [cnn.com](cnn.com) from fake news stories published on [theonion.com](theonion.com)?

## Learning Objectives

-   Define and distinguish between **prior** and **posterior** distributions.
-   Use the **Beta distribution** to construct prior beliefs about a probability.
-   Apply **Bayesian updating** to revise beliefs with observed data.
-   Interpret summary statistics (mean, mode, standard deviation) of Beta distributions.
-   Reflect on how prior information and data interact to shape posterior conclusions.

## Activity Sequence

1.  Introduce the Context
2.  Construct and Visualize Priors
3.  Take the Quiz
4.  Update Priors with Data and Visualize Posterior
5.  Update Priors with Class Data and Visualize Posterior
6.  Compare Posteriors from Different Priors

## 1. Introduce priors

Let $\pi$ be the proportion of correct answers a person guesses right in the CNN vs the Onion quiz.

| Optimistic  | Undecided  | Pessimistic |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Beta(14, 1) | Beta(1, 1) | Beta(5, 10) |

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=7.5, fig.width=17}

optimistic <- plot_beta(14, 1) +
  labs(title = "Optimistic")

undecided <- plot_beta(1, 1) +
  labs(title = "Undecided")

pessimistic <- plot_beta(5, 10) +
  labs(title = "Pessimistic")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(optimistic, undecided, pessimistic, ncol = 3)
```

## 2. Students construct their own prior

The shape parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ can be interpreted as the approximate number of successes and failures.

`Beta(approx_num_correct, approx_num_wrong)`.

```{r}

my_prediction <- plot_beta(alpha = 8, beta = 7) +
  labs(title = "My Prediction")

my_prediction
```

## 3. Discuss vague vs. informative priors

```{r}

vague <- plot_beta(alpha = 2, beta = 2) +
  labs(title = "Vague: alpha = 2, beta = 2")

informative <- plot_beta(alpha = 100, beta = 100) +
  labs(title = "Vague: alpha = 100, beta = 100")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(vague, informative, ncol = 2)
```

## 3. Take the quiz (15 CNN/Onion headlines)

## 4. Update their prior with data

Quiz result: 10/15, Their Prior: Beta(8,7)

```{r echo = TRUE}
summarize_beta_binomial(alpha = 8, beta = 7, y = 10, n = 15)

plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 8, beta = 7, y = 10, n = 15)
```

## 5. All priors

| Optimistic  | Undecided  | Pessimistic | Their Prior |
|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Beta(14, 1) | Beta(1, 1) | Beta(5, 10) | Beta(8, 7)  |

```{r echo = TRUE}
optimistic_prior <- plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 14, beta = 1, y = 10, n = 15)
undecided_prior <- plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 1, beta = 1, y = 10, n = 15)
pessimistic_prior <- plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 5, beta = 10, y = 10, n = 15)
their_prior <- plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 8, beta = 7, y = 10, n = 15)
```

## All Priors

```{r echo = FALSE}
gridExtra::grid.arrange(optimistic_prior, undecided_prior, pessimistic_prior, their_prior, ncol = 2)
```

## 5. Pool with neighbor, then class and repeat update

With class data: 80 correct out of 150 questions

| Optimistic  | Undecided  | Pessimistic | Their Prior |
|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Beta(14, 1) | Beta(1, 1) | Beta(5, 10) | Beta(8, 7)  |

```{r echo = TRUE}
optimist <- plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 14, beta = 1, y = 80, n = 150)
undecided <- plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 1, beta = 1, y = 80, n = 150)
pessimist <- plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 5, beta = 10, y = 80, n = 150)
their_prior <- plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 8, beta = 7, y = 80, n = 150)
```

## 6. Compare effects of prior choice on the posterior

```{r echo = FALSE}
gridExtra::grid.arrange(optimist, undecided, pessimist, their_prior, ncol = 2)
```

## Reflection Questions

-   How does observing more data affect the shape of the posterior?

-   What happens to the posterior mean as you observe more correct or incorrect outcomes?

-   In what ways does the posterior reflect a compromise between prior belief and observed data?
