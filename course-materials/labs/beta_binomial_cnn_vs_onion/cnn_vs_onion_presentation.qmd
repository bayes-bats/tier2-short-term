## Overview

- **Topic:** Using Bayesian updating to teach probability
- **Example:** Real vs. fake news — CNN or The Onion?
- **Goal:** Show how priors, data, and posteriors interact with a real example

---

## Target Course & Placement

- **Course:** Intro to Probability and Statistics (with R)
- **Student background:**
  - Familiar with basic probability
  - Just learned conditional probability and Bayes’ Rule
  
**Suggested Timing:** After Bayes' Rule, before hypothesis testing

---
## Student Background and Course Placement

This activity is designed for students who have a foundational understanding of:

- Basic probability concepts (e.g., probability of success/failure)
- What a probability distribution represents
- Familiarity with the concept of conditional probability

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:

- Define and distinguish between **prior** and **posterior** distributions.
- Use the **Beta distribution** to construct prior beliefs about a probability.
- Apply **Bayesian updating** to revise beliefs with observed data.
- Interpret summary statistics (mean, mode, standard deviation) of Beta distributions.
- Reflect on how prior information and data interact to shape posterior conclusions.

## Activity Overview

1. Students guess how many headlines they think a person is likely to get right (e.g., 10/15)
2. Translate into a Beta prior: Beta(10, 6)
3. Take the quiz (15 CNN/Onion headlines)
4. Update priors (their own, an optimist, pessimist) using own quiz score to get their Posterior
5. Pool with neighbor, then class and repeat update
6. Compare effects of prior choice on the posterior

## Activity Sequence

### 1. Introduce the Context

CNN (the Cable News Network) is widely considered a reputable news source. The Onion, on the other hand, is (according to Wikipedia) “an American news satire organization.

In this activity we will assess people's ability to determine real news stories published on [cnn.com](cnn.com) from fake news stories published on [theonion.com](theonion.com).


---
### 2. Construct Priors

We present three different priors for $\pi$

| Optimistic  | Undecided     | Pessimistic |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Beta(14, 1) | Beta(1, 1) | Beta(5, 10) |


Students construct their own prior, by choosing an expected number of correct answers (out of 15) and translate it into a Beta distribution.

---
### 3. Visualize Priors

- Use `plot_beta()` to examine shapes of priors.
- Students compare their prior to reference priors and discuss informativeness.

---
### 4. Take the Quiz

- Students complete the quiz and count their correct responses.

---
### 5. Update with Data

- Students update their prior using their own score: `plot_beta_binomial()` and `summarize_beta_binomial()`.
- Students repeat the update process adding classmates' scores (n = 30, then n = 45) tallying the correct responses each time.

---
### 6. Update with the Class Data or the Provided Data

- Use the provided data or ask each student to share their score. Add these together. *n* will become 15 x number of students.
- Students update their prior using the class score: `plot_beta_binomial()` and `summarize_beta_binomial()`.

---
### 7. Compare Posteriors

- Visual comparison: look at posterior distributions from different priors side by side.
- Numeric comparison: interpret changes in mean, mode, and standard deviation.
